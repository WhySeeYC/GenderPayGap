## Data cleaning and preparation

1. For tasks 1-3, subset to just University of Oxford
2. For task 4, identify and subset to Russell Group universities - University of Birmingham, University of Bristol, University of Cambridge, Cardiff University, Durham University, University of Edinburgh, University of Exeter, University of Glasgow, Imperial College London, King's College London, University of Leeds, University of Liverpool, London School of Economics and Political Science, University of Manchester, Newcastle University, University of Nottingham, University of Oxford, Queen Mary University of London, Queen's University Belfast, University of Sheffield, University of Southampton, University College London, University of Warwick, University of York

### Assumptions

1. Salary pay bands are comparable across years even if the raw salaries change (for example, lowest band in 2013 is equivalent to lowest band in 2023).

## Model for predicting salary band given sex and academic employment function:

1. Adjusted for academic employment function (i.e. research, teaching, or combined), men are 1.51 (95\% CI = 1.49-1.53) times more likely to be in a higher salary band than women.
2. Adjusted for gender, those in research-only roles are 27.9 (27.3-28.6) times less likely to be in a higher salary band than those that do both research and teaching; those in teaching-only roles are 25.8 (23.8-27.9) times less likely to be in a higher salary band than those that do both research and teaching.
